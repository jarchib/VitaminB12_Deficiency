# Vitamin B12 Deficiency
Analysis of publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2013-2014 to identify variables correlated with low/borderline low vitamin B12 levels <br><br>
##### Project Background
Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient for proper function of the human body, including creating neurological processes, red blood cells, and DNA. Vitamin B12 is gained through the foods what we eat. Many factors can contribute to having a level of vitamin B12 which is too low to properly carry out important processes. The presence of a deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to negative health outcomes including but not limited to: fatigue, weight loss, cognitive impairment, and trouble balancing [(source)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-b12-deficiency-can-be-sneaky-harmful-201301105780). This project seeks to identify and better understand factors that are correlated with having a low or borderline low vitamin B12 level. For the context of this project low vitamin B12 has been defined to include individuals who are clinically low (>200 pg/mL) and borderline low (200-300 pg/mL). This is due to clinical treatments for deficiencies typically occuring when an individual is within this borderline low range to prevent chronic and damaging low levels [(source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077099/). <br><br>
